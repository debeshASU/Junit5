# Junit5
Create a java file - Urinals.java.
It contains a method named - main.
We have to write the logic here.
We will be receiving the string as input.
if it is 1 -> it is occupied and if it is 0 -> it is not occupied.
Our aim is to return the maximum number of urinals available for the next person.


Create a file - UrinalsTest.java.
Add junit 5 dependency to your class path.
use relevant annotations.
use assertEquals to check if we are getting the expected output or not.
